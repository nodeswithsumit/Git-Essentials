## üõë Resolving Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, Git may flag conflicts:

### Conflict Markers:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> their-branch
```

**Steps to Resolve:**
1. Open conflicting files.
2. Remove markers and choose which changes to keep.
3. Save the file.
4. Stage the resolved file:

```bash
git add <file>
```
5. Complete the merge:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

üßπ Ignoring Files
Create a .gitignore file to prevent tracking unwanted files.

---
| Command                              | Purpose                               |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `echo "<pattern>" >> .gitignore`     | Add pattern to ignore files/folders.  |
| `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"`   | Remove file from Git without deleting.|

---

```bash
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
echo "/build/" >> .gitignore
```

üîÑ Remote Repository Operations

---

| Command                        | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `git remote -v`                | Show configured remote repositories.              |
| `git remote add origin <url>`  | Add a remote repository.                          |

| `git fetch <remote>`           | Fetch from a specific remote.                     |
| `git push origin <branch>`     | Push changes to a specific remote branch.         |

‚úÖ Summary Tips
* Always run `git status` before committing or pushing.
* Use `git diff` or `git diff --staged` to review changes.
* Avoid force pushes unless necessary (`git push --force`).
* Keep your feature branches small and focused.
* Resolve conflicts early during merges or rebases.

<mark>‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: When in doubt, use `git reflog` to find past operations and restore lost work. </mark>
